Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Golden_Retriever_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, All the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Golden_Retriever_01.jpg to be the same breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Golden_Retriever_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Golden_Retriever_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Golden_Retriever_01.jpg to be the different breed of dog as that model architecture classified Golden_Retriever_02.jpg.
The difference in the classifications are
AlexNet
Golden_Retriever_01.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:golden retriever 
Golden_Retriever_02.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:norwich terrier 
ResNet
Golden_Retriever_01.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:golden retriever 
Golden_Retriever_02.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:pomeranian  
Vgg
Golden_Retriever_01.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:golden retriever
Golden_Retriever_02.jpg: 
Real:golden retriever   Classifier:pomeranian 

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Lion_01.jpg and Table_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three model architectures correctly classify Lion_01.jpg and Table_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I would select the AlexNet as the best classifying model architecture.
Reasons for my conclusion:
1)AlexNet and Vgg correctly classified all images except the breeed of the Golden_Retriever_02.jpg where as ResNet doesn't coorectly classified the breed of the Golden_Retriever_02.jpg and also it classified Table_01.jpg as folding chair.So i am not going with the ResNet
2)Although AlexNet and Vgg has same results. I selected ALexNet as the best model because of the runtime. AlexNet has runtime of 0:0:2 whereas Vgg has runtime of 0:0:9
3)If we only consider how effectively the models matches whether the image belongs to dog or not then each model performs equally well. When we have to select one among them then also it would be AlexNet because of its total runtime 0:0:2 which is less than the runtime of other models.
Note : The above conclusions is made based on my observations on the data I have taken in the Uploaded_images.
